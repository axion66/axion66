# Hello

I’m diving deep into the worlds of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Time Forecasting**, **NLP**, and **startups**.
My private repos usually contain merges of implementations of latest papers regarding quant, audio, and RL.

### My ML toolbox includes:
- **PyTorch**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, etc — the classics  
- **Gym**, **torch RL** and other deep rl libraries —  I love training agents.

### For apps & APIs:
- Flutter to build slick cross-platform apps  
- GCP for cloud power 
- And a bunch of HTTP & AI APIs to make everything smarter and smoother

### Backend & Web magic:
- Next.js with Vercel for blazing-fast frontends  
- Render, Supabase, Firebase & Clerk for scaling, auth, and data management
