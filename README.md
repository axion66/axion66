# Hello
I’m mostly into the worlds of **Agentic AI**, **Time Forecasting**, and **startups**.
### My ML toolbox includes:
- **PyTorch**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **matplotlib**, and +20 libraries — the classics | **Gym**, **torch RL** and other deep rl libraries —  I love training agents.
### For apps & APIs:
- Flutter to build slick cross-platform apps, GCP for cloud power, and a bunch of HTTP & AI APIs to make everything smarter and smoother
### Backend & Web magic:
- Next.js with Vercel for blazing-fast frontends | Render, Supabase, Firebase & Clerk for scaling, auth, and data management
