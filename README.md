# Hi!

💻 What I Do:
At heart, I'm an AI researcher. I read at least two to five papers per month. I live and breathe deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the bleeding edge of AGI.
I regularly dive into AI open-source communities and specialize in:
🧠 PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, torchRL
…and 20+ other libraries that power modern DL & RL systems.

Lately, I’ve been deep into RLHF on LLM and physical AI where intelligence meets embodiment.

🛠️ Beyond Research:
I’m not just about algorithms—I build things too.

App? I develop with Flutter.

Backend-ready? I use Firebase & Supabase.

Full-stack? On Website side, I’ve built with Next.js, styled with Tailwind, and deployed via Vercel, Render, and more.

APIs? I love GCP, but I'm also good at using APIs or sending https requests.
